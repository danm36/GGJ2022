# Gameplay

Magnetar is a SHMUP/Bullet Hell whereby the enemy's bullets are magnatized. Luckily (or unluckily) for you, so is your ship, and you can flip polarity at your whim. My matching the polarity of the enemy's bullets, you can deflect them. Just be sure to keep an eye of bullets of the opposite polarity, as they'll be attracted to your ship and can deal some serious damage.

Magnetar has two game modes - Single Ship and Dual Ship. Single Ship mode works out how you expect a standard SHMUP to work, with the ship automatically shooting for you so you can focus on dodging and managing your polarity. In Dual Ship mode, there are - as the name suggests - two ships. Each ship is of a fixed, and opposite, polarity. This means that you must work together to help each other dodge and manipulate the bullets, while also not accidentally thowing a bullet in your buddy's face.
